- Wireless application with about 20 nodes
- One node is a transmitter (hooked up to PC)
- Rest are receivers (hooked up to PC if too weak)
- Transmitter sends packets to receivers and receivers decode a message
- Receiver:
	- compute a 20x20 (# nodes) SVD
	- floating point
- Transmitter:
	- must be able to connect to PC (computation is too much)
- range is size of an office to an entire floor
- memory:
	- ideally external memory (e.g. flash/sd)
	- Tens of KBs min, MBs range preferable
